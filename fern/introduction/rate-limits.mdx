# Rate limits

We apply the following rate limits to our REST API. Limits are the same for all environments.

| Endpoints | Methods | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/user/*` | `POST` | 10 per minute |
| `/*` | `GET` `HEAD` | 2,400 per minute |
| `/*` | `POST` `PUT` `PATCH` `DELETE` | 60 per minute |

---

## Handling rate limit errors

When you exceed a limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a JSON error body:

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Requests"
}
```

Check the `Retry-After` response header to see how many seconds to wait before retrying.
