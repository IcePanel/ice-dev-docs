# Introduction

The IcePanel REST API is publicly accessible to write automated scripts or custom integrations with external tools.

Our [OpenAPI 3.1](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification can be found at [api.icepanel.io](https://api.icepanel.io/) and opened by importing it into [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/).

# Authentication

First, generate an API key on your organization management screen. Make sure to copy your key and set the `X-API-Key` HTTP header on any authenticated requests.

```
X-API-Key: SH5XAiWtgevC2ZfQym3i:17a9c60035eed62c8f4f195c754ee6972ffc40ce975c5571ec521f463ebefa7f
```
