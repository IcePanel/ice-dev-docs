# Export objects and relationships

This guide shows how to export IcePanel model objects and relationships. Useful for scenarios like identifying a service's dependencies and ownership during incident response.

IcePanel supports two formats:
1. **CSV** for importing spreadsheets (does not support [Flows](/core-concepts/flows)).
2. **JSON** for build pipelines, scripts, and automation (supports [Flows](/core-concepts/flows)).

## Prerequisites

- [IcePanel account](https://app.icepanel.io/user/sign-up)
- [API key](https://app.icepanel.io)

```bash
export ICEPANEL_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export ICEPANEL_ORGANIZATION_ID='your-organization-id'
```

## Export as CSV

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your landscape">
    Get all landscapes in your organization and select a landscape ID:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /organizations/{organizationId}/landscapes" />

    Note the `id` of the landscape:

    ```bash
    export ICEPANEL_LANDSCAPE_ID='your-landscape-id'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export model objects">
    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects/export/csv" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export model connections">
    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/connections/export/csv" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export as JSON

Export the whole model as JSON which can be easily used as part of a build pipeline, script or automation. This also includes flows which the CSV export does not.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects/{modelObjectId}/dependencies/export/json" />
