title: Create model objects
description: Add new objects to your landscape.
---

This guide shows how to create new objects in your landscape model. Useful for automatically filling out your model from another source.

## Prerequisites

- [IcePanel account](https://app.icepanel.io/user/sign-up)
- [API key](https://app.icepanel.io)

```bash
export ICEPANEL_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export ICEPANEL_ORGANIZATION_ID='your-organization-id'
```

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your landscape">
    Get all landscapes in your organization and select a landscape ID:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /organizations/{organizationId}/landscapes" />

    Note the `id` of the landscape:

    ```bash
    export ICEPANEL_LANDSCAPE_ID='your-landscape-id'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the root object">
      Call a `GET` request with query parameter `?filter[type]=root` to find the root model object. Your landscape may have multiple root model objects if you use domains.

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects" />

    Note the `id` from the response. This is the `parentId` for any top-level objects you create.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an object">
    Create a new model object as a child of the root:

    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Below is a list of different objects you can create.

### Object types
