# Diagrams

Diagrams are C4 visualisations of your model. They are views onto the underlying model [objects](/core-concepts/model-objects) and [connections](/core-concepts/model-connections). The model data exists independently of any diagram, and the same object can appear in multiple diagrams.

## Diagram types

Each diagram type maps to a C4 level of abstraction:

| Type | C4 Level | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `context-diagram` | Level 1 | Shows a `system` in the context of its actors and external systems |
| `app-diagram` | Level 2 | Shows the `app` and `store` containers inside a `system` |
| `component-diagram` | Level 3 | Shows the `component` objects inside an `app` or `store` |
