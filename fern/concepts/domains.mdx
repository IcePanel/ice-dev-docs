# Domains

Domains are named groupings that organise [model objects](/core-concepts/model-objects) into bounded contexts. They map closely to the <Tooltip tip="A software design approach that focuses on modeling software to match a domain. It divides a large system into bounded contexts, each of which have their own model.">Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</Tooltip>.

## What a domain is

Every model object in a version belongs to exactly one domain. Domains provide a way to segment a large architecture either by business unit (e.g., `Payments`) or by team ownership (e.g., `platform`).

## Creating domains

Create a domain in a version:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/domains" />

---

## Filtering model objects by domain

Use the `GET` endpoint with query parameter `?filter[domainId]={domainId}` to filter objects.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects" />

This is useful for extracting a bounded-context slice of the architecture for reports or external tools.
