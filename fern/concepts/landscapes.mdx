# Landscapes

A landscape is the primary workspace in IcePanel. It holds a complete C4 architecture model including all objects, connections, diagrams, flows, and versions.

---

## What a landscape contains

Each landscape is versioned. All models like objects, connections, diagrams, flows, and domains live inside a [version](/core-concepts/versions) of a landscape.

When you create a landscape, IcePanel automatically creates an initial `latest` version that you can modify immediately.

Create a landscape:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /organizations/{organizationId}/landscapes" />

The response returns both the `landscape` and the initial `version` objects.

List all landscapes in your organization:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /organizations/{organizationId}/landscapes" />

## URL patterns

Landscape endpoints are available in two forms.

**Organization-scoped** (includes org context, useful when you have the org ID in scope):
```
GET /organizations/{organizationId}/landscapes/{landscapeId}
```

**Landscape-scoped** (shorter, useful when you already know the landscape ID):
```
GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}
```

All version-scoped resources (model objects, diagrams, flows, etc.) use only the landscape-scoped pattern:
```
GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects
```

You can also specify `latest` as a shorthand for getting the latest version:

```
GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/latest/model/objects
```

## Duplicate vs copy

IcePanel provides two operations for replicating a landscape:

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Duplicate** | Creates a full copy of the landscape within the same organization, including all versions and model content |
| **Copy** | Copies the model content of a specific version into a different target landscape. This is useful for merging two models or seeding a new landscape from an existing one |

Duplicate a landscape:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/duplicate" />

Copy to another landscape:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/copy" />
