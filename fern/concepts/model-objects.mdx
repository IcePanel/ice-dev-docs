# Model Objects

Model objects are the nodes in your architecture graph. They represent the actors, systems, services, and components that make up your software architecture.

## Object types

IcePanel uses the <Tooltip tip="Framework for visualising software architecture through four levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code">C4 model</Tooltip>'s levels of abstraction. Each object type maps to a C4 level:

| Type | C4 Level | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | — | The root node of every [domain](/core-concepts/domains). There is exactly one per domain. All top-level systems and actors are children of the root. |
| `actor` | Level 1 | A person or external role that interacts with your architecture (e.g. "Customer", "Admin") |
| `system` | Level 1 | A top-level software system (e.g. "IcePanel") |
| `group` | Level 1 | A visual grouping (e.g. "Worker Pool", "Subnet") |
| `app` | Level 2 | A deployable unit (container) inside a system: a service, web app, mobile app, or queue |
| `store` | Level 2 | A persistent data store inside a system: a database, blob store, or cache |
| `component` | Level 3 | An internal building block inside an `app` or `store` |

## The parent–child hierarchy

Model objects form a tree. Every object except `root` has a `parentId` pointing to its parent:

```
root
├── actor: Customer
├── system: Payment Service
│   ├── app: API Gateway
│   │   ├── component: Auth Middleware
│   │   └── component: Rate Limiter
│   ├── app: Payment Processor
│   └── store: Transactions DB
└── system: Auth Platform (external)
```

## Creating objects

To create a new object, specify the `landscapeId` and either the `versionId` or `latest`:
<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects" />

---

## Filtering objects

To find the root object (required as `parentId` when creating top-level objects), use the query parameter `?filter[type]=root`

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects" />

The `GET /model/objects` endpoint supports the following filters:

| Query parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `filter[type]` | Object type |
| `filter[status]` | Status lifecycle value |
| `filter[parentId]` | Direct parent ID |
| `filter[domainId]` | Domain ID |
| `filter[external]` | `true` / `false` |
| `filter[tagIds][]` | One or more tag IDs |
| `filter[teamIds][]` | One or more team IDs |
| `filter[technologyIds][]` | One or more technology IDs |
| `filter[labels][key]` | Label key-value pair |
| `filter[name]` | Partial name match |
| `filter[linked]` | `true` to return only objects with at least one link |

---

## Status lifecycle

Objects and connections share a four-state lifecycle representing their architectural status:

```
live  →  deprecated  →  removed →  future
```

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `live` | Current, active element |
| `future` | Planned but not yet built |
| `deprecated` | Still in use but being phased out |
| `removed` | Retired, kept for historical reference |

Use the `filter[status]` query parameter to retrieve only objects with a given status.
