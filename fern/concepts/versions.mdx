# Versions

IcePanel uses a versioning system to let you maintain a live working model while also capturing point-in-time snapshots for communication and history.

---

## The `latest` version

Every [landscape](/core-concepts/landscapes) has a special version with the ID `latest`. This is the live version where you make changes through the IcePanel UI or the API.

Use `latest` in any version-scoped endpoint:

```
GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/latest/model/objects
POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/latest/model/objects
```

---

## Version snapshots

A version snapshot is an immutable copy of the model at a point in time. Snapshots are useful for:

- Marking a release or milestone
- Sharing a stable view of the architecture with stakeholders
- Reverting to a known-good state

Create a snapshot from the current state of `latest`:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions" />

Required fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Version name, e.g. `v2.4.0` or `Q3 2025` |
| `notes` | Description of what changed in this version |
| `modelHandleId` | The `handleId` of the root model object to snapshot |

Once created, a snapshot version is read-only. Its ID is a system-generated string (not `latest`).

List all versions for a landscape:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions" />

---

## Version reverts

Roll back a landscape to the state captured in a previous snapshot:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /landscapes/{landscapeId}/version/reverts" />

Required fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `versionId` | The snapshot to revert to |
| `notes` | Reason for the revert |

A revert creates a new entry in the revert history and replaces the `latest` version with the snapshot state. The snapshot itself is not modified.
