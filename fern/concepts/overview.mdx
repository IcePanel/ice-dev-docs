description: Understand the IcePanel data model before building integrations
---

The IcePanel API is built around a set of concepts called the **Data Model** that you'll see throughout every endpoint.

---

## Key concepts

**[Organization](/core-concepts/organizations)**
The top-level model for access control. All landscapes and users belong to an organization.

**[Landscape](/core-concepts/landscapes)**
A self-contained model workspace (like a repository). An organization can have multiple landscapes for different products or teams.

**[Version](/core-concepts/versions)**
A snapshot of a landscape's model. The `latest` version is the live editable version. Numbered versions are immutable snapshots created at meaningful points in time. All model data is scoped to a version.

**[Domain](/core-concepts/domains)**
A bounded context that groups related model objects. Every model object belongs to exactly one domain.

**[Model (Object)](/core-concepts/model-objects)**
A node in the architecture graph. Can be a `system`, `app`, `component`, `store`, `actor`, `group`, or `root`. Objects form a parent–child hierarchy and can carry tags, technology associations, and custom labels.

**[Model (Connection)](/core-concepts/model-connections)**
A defined relationship between two model objects. Represents a dependency, data flow, or API call.

**[Diagram](/core-concepts/diagrams)**
A view onto the model. The underlying model objects and connections exist independently of any diagram.

**[Flow](/core-concepts/flows)**
A step-by-step sequence that traces a path through model objects and connections. Useful for documenting user journeys, request paths, or data flows.

## Data Model hierarchy

```
Organization
├── Team
└── Landscape
    └── Version
        ├── Domain
        ├── Model (Object)
        │   └── Model Objects Children (Recursive)
        ├── Model (Connection)
        ├── Flow
        ├── Comment
        ├── Draft
        └── Share Link
```

Everything beneath a version is **version-scoped**. When you read or write model objects, connections, diagrams, flows, tags, or domains, you always specify both a `landscapeId` and a `versionId`:

```
/landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/model/objects
/landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/diagrams
/landscapes/{landscapeId}/versions/{versionId}/flows
```

Use `latest` to select the live editable version. Use a version ID (e.g. `xqD4yXmqukb1LKaMAAUL`) to select an immutable snapshot.
