# Model Connections

Model connections are the edges of the <Tooltip tip="Actors, systems, services, and components that make up your software architecture.">model objects</Tooltip> in your architecture. They represent relationships, dependencies, API calls, data flows, or any meaningful interaction between two model objects.

## Filtering connections

The `GET /model/connections` endpoint supports filtering:

| Query parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `filter[originId]` | Connections starting from a specific object |
| `filter[targetId]` | Connections ending at a specific object |
| `filter[viaId]` | Connections passing through a specific object |
| `filter[direction]` | `outgoing` or `bidirectional` |
| `filter[status]` | Status lifecycle value |
| `filter[tagIds][]` | One or more tag IDs |
| `filter[technologyIds][]` | One or more technology IDs |
| `filter[labels][key]` | Label key-value pair |
| `filter[name]` | Partial name match |
| `filter[linked]` | `true` to return only connections with at least one link |

## Status lifecycle

Connections share the same four-state lifecycle as [model objects](/core-concepts/model-objects):

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `live` | Active dependency or relationship |
| `future` | Planned but not yet implemented |
| `deprecated` | In use but being phased out |
| `removed` | Retired, kept for historical reference |
